      <p>I'm a designer and developer based in NYC & SF. I’m 
        passionate about design and technology, and I’m especially 
        interested in rethinking how user experiences can be made more 
        playful and human.
        
        studying <em>Computer Science & Interactive 
        Media Arts @ NYU Tisch</em>.
        In my free time, I love to knit, collect 
        zines, and try out new bakeries.
