                    <p class="mb-4">This is a hypothetical logo and poster I designed 
                        for Interactive Media Arts (IMA), which is my department at NYU.
                        I created this in my <em>Design Fundamentals</em> class
                        taught by Professor Katherine Dillon.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        IMA doesn't currently have an official logo, so I started from 
                        scratch when brainstorming the design. 
                        
                        The department is
                        extremely interdisciplinary, focusing on the intersection of 
                        art and technology. Classes explore how digital interactivity 
                        can be used as a creative medium, in contexts like design, 
                        VR/AR, physical computing, web development, games, animation, 
                        digital fabrication, and more. 
                        
                        In the initial brainstorming, I made a mind map of everything 
                        I associated with IMA, because I wanted to make sure the logo 
                        could tell a clear and accurate story about IMA's fundamental 
                        identity -- even to someone who has no prior knowledge of it.
                    </p>

                    <div class="mb-5">
                        <img src="../../assets/images/projects/mushroom-tote/inspiration.png" alt="Inspiration Images" />
                    </div>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        From this, I started sketching rough ideas out on paper, 
                        coming up with as many ideas as possible before trying to
                        narrow them down.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        I took my two favorite concepts from these sketches and 
                        then developed them further in Figma.

                        The first concept I liked was inspired by wooden tangram 
                        puzzles, as a nod to IMA's combination of logical thinking, 
                        problem-solving, and creativity. It also evokes themes of 
                        physicality and play. However, I realized that it slightly 
                        resembled blackletter-style typefaces and felt a little 
                        stiff and old-fashioned as a result. It is also quite complex 
                        and wouldn't translate well to the small dimensions of a 
                        browser icon, for instance.

                        The second concept I liked was entirely composed of circles 
                        and squares, inspired by the geometric compositions of modern
                        art and design movements like Bauhaus. I loved the playfulness,
                        modernity, and simplicity of this one, but it wasn't as readable, 
                        especially when I tried adding color to it.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        I iterated on these and finally came up with a logo that combined
                        the tangram shapes of the first concept with the modernity and 
                        simplicity of the second.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        I also came up with a poster design for the ITP/IMA Winter Show, a joint
                        showcase of student projects between the graduate Interactive 
                        Telecommunications program and the undergraduate Interactive 
                        Media Arts program. The brief asked for designs that focused 
                        on themes of physicality and connectedness. I was inspired by
