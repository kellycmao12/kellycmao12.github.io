                    <p class="mb-4">This is a bag inspired by sustainable fashion and biodesign (and mushrooms, of course).
                    </p>

                        <em>Contribution: </em>Design, 3D Modeling, Post-Processing<br>
                        <em>Technologies: </em>Adobe Illustrator, Fusion360
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sustainability in fashion has always been really important to me, due to 
                        the sheer amount of waste and depletion of natural resources that 
                        come with fast fashion and mass-producing clothes. In this project, 
                        I was inspired by the fashion industry's use of experimental textiles 
                        made of sustainable renewable resources like mushrooms, and the fact 
                        that mushrooms are one of the most environmentally friendly crops and 
                        can even help break down and recycle plastic.
                        I also was motivated by how
                        designers are starting to experiment with 3D-printing as a 
                        possibility to reduce waste and mass production. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to make a bag that looked like it was partly made of mushrooms 
                        with other elements made of repurposed plastic items to represent 
                        the cycle of decomposition and regrowth of fungi, and more broadly, the 
                        circularity we should strive for in the fashion industry. Moreover, I wanted 
                        this bag to embody slow fashion -- a mindful, curated, quality-over-quantity 
                        approach to clothing production. Thus, I utilized crochet and 3D-printing 
                        which inherently require patience and small-scale production.
                      
                        <!-- In particular, I designed the bag 
                        to resemble a mushroom grow block, which is a plastic bag full of sawdust, 
                        recycled materials/compost, and mycelium that allows people to grow mushrooms at home.  -->

                        Ideally, this bag would inspire its user to reflect on the circularity 
                        and sustainability of their own clothing items and shopping habits.

                        I developed this in my Interactive Media Arts class 
                        <em>Intro to Digital Fabrication</em> taught by Professor Phil Caridi.

                    <h3 class="mb-4">Inspiration</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        During the initial design phase, I was really inspired by artists who 
                        played with surrealism, biomimicry, texture, and unconventional materials. 
                        I also gathered lots of mushroom images.
                    </p>

                        <img src="../../assets/images/projects/mushroom-tote/inspiration.png" alt="Inspiration Images" />
                    </div>

                    <h3 class="mb-4">Initial Design and 3D Models</h3>
                    
                    <div class="mb-4">
                        <img src="../../assets/images/projects/mushroom-tote/initial design.png" alt="Initial Design" />
                    </div>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        I originally wanted to print the bag all as one piece of thin flexible TPU. 
                        However, my prints of this version would always fail or go over the allotted 
                        time limit because TPU is slower and less precise to print, so I later decided 
                        to print the bag in pieces and use PLA instead. Also, to minimize the amount of 
                        3D printing I had to do (since it's time + resource intensive), I laser cut 
                        sheets of acrylic for the flat panels of the bag that didn't need any special 3D detailing.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                        For the mushrooms, I wanted to print lots of individual mushrooms and glue 
                        them on in overlapping layers, but I later realized that would look messy,
                        so I decided to print them all at once in a cluster which I could then 
                        attach straight onto the side of the bag.
