                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Albert is the portal where NYU students sign up for 
                        courses. Many students feel that Albert is confusing 
                        and difficult to navigate, making the already stressful task of 
                        finding and registering for courses even more challenging. 
                        
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="space"></div>

            
                <h3 class="mb-4">Initial Research</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    To get a better understanding of the problem, I researched the 
                    difficulties NYU students currently face with Albert’s course search 
                    interface. I then looked at course search platforms similar to Albert 
                    to see how they addressed these concerns.
                </p>
                <div class="space"></div>

                <h5 class="mb-4">User Research</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                     I interviewed my friends and roommates, and looked at 
                    complaints students had posted in online communities.
                </p>

                <p>The biggest problems I gathered were the <em>sheer amount and repetition 
                    of course result information, the hard-to-use filters, and the lack 
                    of emphasis on the important information about each course.</em>

            <div class="mt-4 mb-5 col-12 offset-sm-0 col-md-8 offset-md-2 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 vertical-center">

                <p class="mb-4">
                    From this, I developed my main goals for the redesign.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Provide a balance of being able to discover new courses 
                            and easily find courses you are looking for.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Display adequate information about all courses so students 
                            can learn what they are about, while organizing the 
                            information well so that it’s easy to skim through if users 
                            are looking for a specific course.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Design better systems for filtering classes and add options 
                            to save searches for future use.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="space"></div>
                </p>

                
                <h5 class="mb-4">Researching Other Platforms</h5>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    I looked at similar systems used by other institutions 
                    to see how they address the problems listed above.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The course search systems I looked at were 
                    De Anza College, a California community college I took classes at during 
                    high school, and edX, a website that offers free online courses 
                    from leading educational institutions.
                </p>
                <div class="space"></div>

                </div>
                
                <p class="mb-4">
                    After looking at De Anza’s site, I believe the table view would be 
                    a good choice for Albert in order to highlight only the most 
                    important information. However, I still think there is value in 
                    displaying the course descriptions directly in the search results, 
                    so students can learn more about a class without having to open up 
                    a new page each time they see an interesting class title. I also 
                    would still like to visually group sections of the same course.
                </p>
                <div class="space"></div>
                <div class="mb-5">
                    <img src="../../assets/images/projects/albert/edx findings.png" alt="edX Findings"/>
                </div>
            
                <p class="mb-4">
                    After looking at edX’s site, I think their design decisions wouldn’t 
                    suit Albert. edX’s business model relies on the reputation of their 
                    partner institution to attract users, so their course search page is 
                    more marketing-based, with background images and logos of the 
                    universities hosting each class. In addition, their courses are self-paced, 
                    so there is no information necessary regarding days and times. 
                    On the other hand, students using Albert are not just shopping casually 
                    for exciting classes, but also trying to efficiently find required classes.

                    the three main screens.

                    I then made a low-fidelity, clickable prototype in Figma.

            <div class="mt-4 mb-4 col-12 offset-sm-0 col-md-8 offset-md-2 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 vertical-center">
                <p class="mb-4">
                    During prototyping, I decided to add a subheading to each course 
                    displaying which college within NYU the course was in, which campus 
                    (Washington Square or Brooklyn), and the number of units. Albert currently
                    lists that for each section of the course, leading to repetition.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    In this prototype, I still felt that there was a lot of extra 
                    information taking up the page, specifically supplementary information 
                    about a course such as prerequisites, recommended experience levels, 
                    and which requirements it fulfilled. While a student who is considering 
                    taking the course should definitely read this information, it is not 
                    necessary to display it to every student who is just browsing through 
                    the results, and it would lead to each course taking up considerably 
                    more space on the page.
                </p>

                <!-- <div class="mb-5">

                </div> -->

                <p class="mb-4">
                    For the final design, I split up course information into 
                    2 parts: the course description (displayed by default), 
                    and the supplementary information (hidden under the “See notes” 
                    button).

                <h5 class="mb-4">Final Design</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    For my final UI design, I used colors consistent with NYU branding, 
                    and added color and drop shadow to buttons to emphasize that they 
                    could be interacted with. I think this is especially helpful on the 
                    course results page, because there are buttons within each table to 
                    add that course. They are greyed out or filled in purple depending 
                    on whether the course is closed or not.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    After working on this project, I am more confident designing with 
                    Figma’s components, auto layout, and prototyping features. It was 
                    also interesting because Albert is a tool I use every semester to 
                    search for and register for classes, so it was easy for me to 
                    empathize with the user on this project and pull from my experience 
                    to make decisions throughout the design process. I know that in 
                    future projects I will probably not align with the target user, 
                    which will make user testing and research all the more necessary.

                    If this were implemented in real life, some of the key metrics I 
                    would look at are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The average time between users opening the course search 
                            and adding a course to their shopping cart (aiming for 
                            shorter times).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use rates of features like filtering results and favoriting 
                            searches.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Click rates on “see notes” options for course results.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
