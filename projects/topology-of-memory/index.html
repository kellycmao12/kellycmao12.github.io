                    <p class="mb-4">
                        As part of a UX design class, my group was tasked to research a 
                        problem with the library experience and come up with a solution. 
                        We centered in on the idea of <em>creating community within libraries 
                        through spotlighting the events they offered.</em> Our final product 
                        was a clickable prototype of an app that helps people keep track 
                        of events and stay in touch with other patrons.

                <h3 class="mb-4">Problem</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Many people think of the library as a place to sit by themselves for 
                    hours, deep in research or homework, in complete silence only 
                    broken by the occasional typing of keys or turning of a page. While 
                    this is an important capacity, it can create an overall 
                    depressing, sterile, and oppressive atmosphere and deter people from 
                    going if this is their sole experience of what a library is.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Libraries, at their core, are more than just study spaces 
                    or resources for checking out books. When we talked to the children’s 
                    librarian at Ottendorfer Library in the East Village, she emphasized 
                    the idea of <em>library as community center:</em>
                </p>
                <p class="quote-pink mb-4">
                    “A library is really one of the only spaces in a community open to 
                    anyone, free of charge, where people of all ages and demographics can 
                    congregate and benefit from the shared resources.”
                </p>
                <div class="mb-4">

                </div>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    This idea of a social library experience really captivated us, as we 
                    felt that it had been overlooked in our preliminary interviews and 
                    other libraries we had visited.  My team wanted to <em>focus on ways we 
                    could introduce more community engagement within libraries, and open 
                    up opportunities for socialization and conversation.</em>

                <h5 class="mb-4">User Research</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    As part of research, we visited libraries in the New York Public 
                    Library (NYPL) system and cold-interviewed people we found there. 
                    <em>Talking to the children’s librarian inspired us to focus on 
                    interviewing parents who brought their children to the library, as 
                    we felt that they would especially benefit from a more community-
                    oriented library experience.</em>  In total, we interviewed 9 
                    members of our target demographic (4 caregivers and 5 parents). 
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    From interviewing people at the library, we found that a lot of 
                    parents and caregivers (babysitters, nannies, etc) agreed that the 
                    library <em>should be a social environment</em> — a place where kids can 
                    socialize on their own and develop interpersonal skills. Many of them 
                    took advantage of the <em>free library events</em> for that reason, 
                    which ranged from weekly storytime and playtime to special/seasonal 
                    events like outdoor concerts and film festivals. However, they still 
                    faced some <em>difficulties when it came to staying up to date on events, 
                    planning ahead, and figuring out which new events to go to.</em>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    We also interviewed parents who did not use the library for social 
                    purposes at all, and found that a lot of them <em>simply lacked 
                    awareness</em> of these free activities but <em>would be interested 
                    in participating</em> if it were easier to find out about them. Currently, 
                    they are only advertised through physical flyers in the library and a 
                    hard-to-use event search page on the NYPL website.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    We created a user persona based on the parents we interviewed, to 
                    summarize their needs and pain points and guide our thinking in 
                    the design phase.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Our findings naturally pushed us to ask:

                    "How might we help parents and their kids better connect with their

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Before we could design an improvement, we had to research the current 
                    event search interface on the NYPL website.

                    The main problems we found with the current system are:

                    <li>

                        Requires user to adjust many filters each time they open the

                    Rather than redesigning this, we wanted to design a completely new way

                    To further explore our initial ideas, we imagined what the user 
                    journey of a parent using our app might look like.

                    After getting positive feedback on the storyboard from parents we 
                    interviewed, we continued by mapping out specific features and 
                    pages we wanted in the app.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    At this stage, we presented our app concept and wireframing progress 
                    to four UX designers invited to critique. Talking to the designers 
                    helped draw our attention to a few key gaps in our designs so far.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    To make sure we had a unified view of the app's look and feel before 
                    fleshing out the designs, my group collected images that inspired us.
                    We embraced <em>bright pastel colors and friendly rounded bubble shapes</em>, 
                    to make the app as <em>kid-friendly</em> as possible.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The goal was to design a <em>user experience that would be fun for the 
                    parent and child to do together</em>, so that finding activities became 
                    less of a chore for the parent and more of <em>a chance 
                    to explore and get excited about new events.</em>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    I took on most of the work in transitioning from low-fidelity wireframes 
                    to the final prototype, and making sure the visual language of the app 
                    was consistent between all screens.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Our final product is organized into four components, broken down below.

                            When you first log in, you can help the app get to know you better 
                            by inputting your event preferences and interests in a short quiz.

                            events. You can also share the event and see which of your friends

                            You can also view your existing event plans and accept invitations

                <h3 class="mb-4">Takeaways</h3>

                <ol class="mb-4">
                    <li class="mb-4">
                        This was my first time working within a formal design thinking 
                        framework, so I got to see how each step helps designers create a more 
                        compelling and useful product. I got firsthand experience with the 
                        process of going wide with research and ideation and then narrowing 
                        in during prototyping, as well as using tools like immersive research, 
                        post-it/whiteboard exercises, and storyboarding to generate and explore ideas.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-4">
                        I learned how to properly conduct user interviews. It was extremely 
                        important to my group that we fully understand the user’s story by 
                        asking open-ended questions and not just go into the interview trying 
                        to confirm our assumptions. I’m also proud of my efforts to go beyond 
                        my own network by cold-interviewing strangers I met in the library, 
                        since it led to more diverse and insightful perspectives.
