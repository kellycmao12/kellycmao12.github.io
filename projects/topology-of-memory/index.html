                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Topology of Memory is an interactive map meant to shed light on the invisible, intimate histories people form 
                        within the urban landscape, specifically in New York City. The project stems from the concept that a city 
                        is not merely defined by its physical composition or architecture, but 
                        rather by the people in it — how they navigate the city, what each individual 
                        chooses to perceive and remember about the city, and the invisible associations 
                        people assign in their minds to specific places. By giving people a way to 
                        document their stories, the project aims to help people reinforce their 
                        critical insight into their own memories of the city and find commonalities 
                        with those of others.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Users can view other people's memories and are encouraged to physically 
                        visit the locations others have written about on the map, where they will 
                        be able to further interact with a memory and leave traces of their own 
                        presence. Through prompting users to view the stories in the spatial context 
                        they occurred in, the project strives to reconnect people to their local 
                        environment so they may become aware of a place’s deeper significance and 
                        new ways of looking at the city around them.

                        In the novel <em>Invisible Cities</em>, Italo Calvino highlights 
                        the fact that a city is not merely defined by its physical composition 
                        or architecture, but rather by the people in it — how they navigate the 
                        city, what each individual chooses to perceive and remember about the 
                        city, and the invisible associations people assign in their minds to 
                        specific places. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        As New Yorkers, each of us accumulate our own histories 
                        within the city, and different places begin to take on extremely personal 
                        significance to us. For example, the cafe that made you feel at home when 
                        you were first adjusting to life here, the street corner where you had a 
                        memorable interaction with a stranger, or the first place where you hung 
                        out with a friend. For the most part, however, we keep these stories to 
                        ourselves and we have no way of learning about the unique places and 
                        memories that are important to other New Yorkers.

                        For my project, I wanted to build a collective archive of these lived 
                        experiences.
