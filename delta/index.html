                    <p class="mb-4">This is a personal project I worked on to redesign 
                        the Delta Airlines boarding pass, as part of my <em>Design 
                        Fundamentals</em> class taught by Professor Katherine Dillon.

                    <h3 class="mb-4">Overview</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The entire air travel process is extremely stressful to begin with, 
                        and as a passenger, your boarding pass can either make or 
                        break that experience. Below is a real Delta boarding pass 
                        my professor received on a flight from Rome to NYC. With its lack of 
                        information hierarchy, cramped and overlapping text, and 
                        incomprehensible codes scattered throughout, it more closely 
                        resembles a word scramble than a helpful guide of flight information.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        There are countless more examples of confusing boarding passes out there, 
                        showing that this is a huge user experience problem affecting anyone 
                        trying to navigate an airport. In this project, I decided to tackle 
                        the question of how to better design a boarding pass that
                        would help passengers board their flights without getting lost or 
                        missing their boarding time, as well as make the jobs of airport 
                        workers easier and more efficient.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="mb-4">Original Delta Boarding Pass</h5>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-4">
                    <h3 class="mb-4">Project Constraints</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        I first defined some constraints for the project to make sure my design would 
                        retain all the desired functionality and be practical to adopt.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        First, I had to include all of the same information as the original boarding pass. 
                        This included textual information (flight details, passenger details, identification 
                        codes, etc) as well as graphical information (Delta logo, barcodes).
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- <div class="mb-4">

                <div class="mb-4">
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Assuming that an airline would have to print my design using their current system, 
                        I kept the same shape and size for the pass. I included color in my design since 
                        the original one had the logo in color, but I also designed a black-and-white 
                        version to accommodate potential cost restrictions.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-4">
                    <h3 class="mb-4">Categorizing Information</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        I started out by categorizing the information by content type and sequence so that 
                        I could get a better sense of how to organize information on the boarding pass.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Recognizing that a boarding pass has two types of users â€” passengers and airport 
                        workers, I sorted the information by content type. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-4">

                </div>
                
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Next, I thought about how passengers would use the boarding pass throughout 
                        the entire stage between printing it out and boarding their flight. I wanted 
                        my design to present the information the user needs in the chronological order 
                        that they need it. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        I identified the main information I wanted to highlight, and the order the 
                        passenger would need them in.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Then, I created two wireframes organized by content type and sequence.

                    <h5 class="mb-4">Final Product</h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Here is my final boarding pass layout, designed in Figma.
                    </p>

                <div class="mb-4">
                    <h5 class="mb-4">Previous Iterations</h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        For my first iteration, I was mainly focused on trying to lay out the 
                        information in a more organized way than the original pass. However, I 
                        didn't incorporate enough hierarchy, and as a result, it was difficult 
                        to skim and find the most important information.
                    </p>
                    <div class="mb-4">
                        <img src="../../assets/images/projects/delta/attempt 1.png" alt="First Iteration" />
                    </div>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The main feedback I got from my first iteration was to include more negative 
                        space to make the individual elements more distinct, and use more color 
                        to create hierarchy.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        To create more negative space, I decreased the font size of the less-important 
                        text like field labels and identification codes so the most important text would 
                        have room to breathe. I also changed the text from all-caps to title case and 
                        decreased the kerning to help with readability.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        I decided to use the Delta logo's colors to highlight 
                        the information the passenger will most likely be looking for: departure 
                        time, gate, boarding class, and seat number. While the other information is 
                        important as well, the passenger will most likely already know things like 
                        flight origin and destination without needing to look them up. Below you can 
                        see the different layouts I tried for highlighting this boarding information 
                        (in order from right to left, top to bottom). 
                    </p>
                    <div class="mb-4">

                    </div>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        In the version I finally decided on (bottom right), the diagonal divider helps to further 
                        break up the information sequentially. Before the passenger finds their gate, 
                        they need to know their boarding time and gate number, which are both in blue.
                        After they reach their gate, they need to know their boarding class and seat 
                        number, which are in red.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Here is a summary of these design decisions, as well as a few other considerations, 
                        that led me to my final product.
